ReclaimitAI is an AI-powered Lost and Found Portal designed to help users report and reclaim lost or found items. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision, ReclaimitAI matches lost item reports with found ones based on both text descriptions and images.


## How It Works

1. **Users Report Lost or Found Items**: Fill out a form with a description and optional image.
2. **AI Matching Engine**: Uses models like BERT and CLIP to generate embeddings and compare similarities.
3. **Automated Notifications**: Users are notified if a potential match is found.
4. **Verified Claim Process**: Contact info is exchanged securely for claim verification.
